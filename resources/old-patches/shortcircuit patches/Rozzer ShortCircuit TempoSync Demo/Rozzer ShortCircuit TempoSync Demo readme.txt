This ShortCircuit multi program is designed to demonstrate the brilliant TempoSync modulation source.

How to use the program properly:

1. Load up ShortCircuit in your favourite host (it even works with ShortCircuit Free version!), then set your host tempo to 135 bpm. Otherwise the included loop will not sync properly.

2. Load the included multi into ShortCircuit.

2. Play keys C1 upwards and discover just how cool ShortCircuit can be ! :D.... remember, the whole program only uses one 2-bar loop!

If you want to, you can easily replace Funky Beat.wav with your own loop, but still keep all the cool zone assignments...

have fun,
